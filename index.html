      <h3>"Starry Night" - 1889</h3>
      <p>The painting depicts the scene outside Van Gogh's hospital room in a psychiatric hospital located in the South of France. This scene was observed by him through the hospital room window at night. However, Van Gogh drew it from memory during the day because at night no patient was allowed to "sleep".</p>

      <h3>"Olive Trees" - 1889</h3>
      <p>Van Gogh painted at least 18 paintings of olive trees during his treatment at a psychiatric hospital in the South of France. His room's window then opened onto an olive grove. The painting "Olive Trees" is always considered a parallel painting to the painting "Starry Night".</p>

      <h3>"Café at night" - 1888</h3>
      <p>This movie still revolves around the theme of the adventure of Doraemon's group of friends. Here, the group is determined to find a crescent-shaped island floating in the sky with the desire for perfection - Paradapia. It's perfect that in that place, our lazy, clumsy Nobita can also become an excellent elementary school student.</p>

      <img src="imges/anh1.png" alt="Iris" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Iris</h3>
      <p>The iris was painted before his first seizure in the asylum. The painting lacks the high tension often found in his later works. He called the painting “a lightning rod for his illness,” because he felt that he could stop himself from going crazy by continuing to paint.
        The painting is influenced by the Japanese woodcut genre ukiyo-e, similar to many other works by van Gogh as well as other artists of the time. The similarity is expressed in bold outlines, unusual angles and flat coloring that does not follow the direction of the light.

      <h3>Group of paintings "Sunflowers" - 1890</h3>
      <p>Van Gogh finished painting 4 masterpieces depicting sunflowers in just 6 days. He kept his emotions and sanity during those 6 days with coffee and alcohol.</p>

      <h3>"Portrait of Doctor Gachet" - 1890</h3>
      <p>Portrait of Doctor Gachet” is one of the most famous paintings by Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh. Doctor Paul Gachet in the painting is the one who took care of Van Gogh in the last years of his life.</p>

      <h3>"Sad old man" (or "On the threshold of eternity") - 1890</h3>
      <p>This painting was made when Van Gogh began to recover from a severe depression, which was also two months before his death - a mysterious death that people at that time concluded was caused by suicidal.</p>

      <img src="imges/8_SXMH.jpg" alt="Series of self-portraits" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Series of self-portraits</h3>
      <p>In Van Gogh's career, it is impossible not to mention his self-portraits. Van Gogh painted dozens of self-portraits with different styles.
        The special thing is that Van Gogh rarely looks directly into the viewer's eyes in the painting.
        In addition, when Van Gogh painted himself, he often observed himself through a mirror, so in fact the right side of the painting was his left side and vice versa.</p>
